heading recollections development mind character end with following note aug 3 1876 this sketch life was begun about 28th hopedene mr hensleigh wedgwood s house surrey since then have written nearly an hour on most afternoons it will easily understood narrative personal intimate kind written his wife children passages should occur must here omitted have not thought it necessary indicate where such omissions are made it has been found necessary make few corrections obvious verbal slips but number such alterations has been kept down minimum f d german editor having written me an account development mind character with sketch autobiography have thought attempt would amuse me possibly interest children or their children know it would have interested me greatly have read even so short dull sketch mind grandfather written by himself what he thought did how he worked have attempted write following account myself if were dead man another world looking back own life nor have found this difficult life nearly over with me have taken no pains about style writing was born shrewsbury on february 12th 1809 earliest recollection goes back only when was few months over four years old when went near abergele sea bathing recollect events places there with little distinctness mother died july 1817 when was little over eight years old it odd can remember hardly anything about her except her death bed her black velvet gown her curiously constructed work table spring this same year was sent day school shrewsbury where stayed year have been told was much slower learning than younger sister catherine believe was many ways naughty boy by time went this day school kept by rev g case minister unitarian chapel high street mrs darwin was unitarian attended mr case s chapel father little boy went there with his elder sisters but both he his brother were christened intended belong church england after his early boyhood he seems usually have gone church not mr case s it appears st james gazette dec 15 1883 mural tablet has been erected his memory chapel now known free christian church taste natural history more especially collecting was developed tried make out names plants rev w leighton was schoolfellow father s mr case s school remembers his bringing flower school saying his mother had taught him how by looking inside blossom name plant could discovered mr leighton goes on this greatly roused attention curiosity enquired him repeatedly how this could done but his lesson was naturally enough not transmissible f d collected all sorts things shells seals franks coins minerals passion collecting leads man systematic naturalist virtuoso or miser was very strong me was clearly innate none sisters or brother ever had this taste one little event during this year has fixed itself very firmly mind hope it has done so from conscience having been afterwards sorely troubled by it it curious showing apparently was interested this early age variability plants told another little boy believe it was leighton afterwards became known lichenologist botanist could produce variously coloured polyanthuses primroses by watering them with certain coloured fluids was course monstrous fable had never been tried by me here also confess little boy was much given inventing deliberate falsehoods this was always done sake causing excitement instance once gathered much valuable fruit from father s trees hid it shrubbery then ran breathless haste spread news had discovered hoard stolen fruit must have been very simple little fellow when first went school boy name garnett took me into cake shop one day bought cakes he did not pay shopman trusted him when came out asked him why he did not pay them he instantly answered why do you not know uncle left great sum money town on condition every tradesman should give whatever was wanted without payment any one wore his old hat moved it particular manner he then showed me how it was moved he then went into another shop where he was trusted asked small article moving his hat proper manner course obtained it without payment when came out he said now if you like go by yourself into cake shop how remember its exact position will lend you hat you can get whatever you like if you move hat on your head properly gladly accepted generous offer went asked cakes moved old hat was walking out shop when shopman made rush me so dropped cakes ran dear life was astonished by being greeted with shouts laughter by false friend garnett can say own favour was boy humane but owed this entirely instruction example sisters doubt indeed whether humanity natural or innate quality was very fond collecting eggs but never took more than single egg out bird s nest except on one single occasion when took all not their value but from sort bravado had strong taste angling would sit any number hours on bank river or pond watching float when maer house his uncle josiah wedgwood was told could kill worms with salt water from day never spitted living worm though expense probably loss success once very little boy whilst day school or before time acted cruelly beat puppy believe simply from enjoying sense power but beating could not have been severe puppy did not howl feel sure spot was near house this act lay heavily on conscience shown by remembering exact spot where crime was committed it probably lay all heavier from love dogs being then long time afterwards passion dogs seemed know this was an adept robbing their love from their masters remember clearly only one other incident during this year whilst mr case s daily school namely burial dragoon soldier it surprising how clearly can still see horse with man s empty boots carbine suspended saddle firing over grave this scene deeply stirred whatever poetic fancy there was me summer 1818 went dr butler s great school shrewsbury remained there seven years still midsummer 1825 when was sixteen years old boarded this school so had great advantage living life true schoolboy but distance was hardly more than mile home very often ran there longer intervals between callings over before locking up night this think was many ways advantageous me by keeping up home affections interests remember early part school life often had run very quickly time from being fleet runner was generally successful but when doubt prayed earnestly god help me remember attributed success prayers not quick running marvelled how generally was aided have heard father elder sister say had very young boy strong taste long solitary walks but what thought about know not often became quite absorbed once whilst returning school on summit old fortifications round shrewsbury had been converted into public foot path with no parapet on one side walked off fell ground but height was only seven or eight feet nevertheless number thoughts passed through mind during this very short but sudden wholly unexpected fall was astonishing seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have believe proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable amount time nothing could have been worse development mind than dr butler s school it was strictly classical nothing else being taught except little ancient geography history school means education me was simply blank during whole life have been singularly incapable mastering any language especial attention was paid verse making this could never do had many friends got together good collection old verses by patching together sometimes aided by other boys could work into any subject much attention was paid learning by heart lessons previous day this could effect with great facility learning forty or fifty lines virgil or homer whilst was morning chapel but this exercise was utterly useless every verse was forgotten forty eight hours was not idle with exception versification generally worked conscientiously classics not using cribs sole pleasure ever received from such studies was from odes horace admired greatly when left school was age neither high nor low it believe was considered by all masters by father very ordinary boy rather below common standard intellect deep mortification father once said me you care nothing but shooting dogs rat catching you will disgrace yourself all your family but father was kindest man ever knew whose memory love with all heart must have been angry somewhat unjust when he used such words looking back can character during school life only qualities this period promised future were had strong diversified tastes much zeal whatever interested me keen pleasure understanding any complex subject or thing was taught euclid by private tutor distinctly remember intense satisfaction clear geometrical proofs gave me remember with equal distinctness delight uncle gave me father francis galton by explaining principle vernier barometer with respect diversified tastes independently science was fond reading various books used sit hours reading historical plays shakespeare generally an old window thick walls school read also other poetry such thomson s seasons recently published poems byron scott mention this because later life wholly lost great regret all pleasure from poetry any kind including shakespeare connection with pleasure from poetry add 1822 vivid delight scenery was first awakened mind during riding tour on borders wales this has lasted longer than any other aesthetic pleasure early school days boy had copy wonders world often read disputed with other boys about veracity statements believe this book first gave me wish travel remote countries was ultimately fulfilled by voyage beagle latter part school life became passionately fond shooting do not believe any one could have shown more zeal most holy cause than did shooting birds how remember killing first snipe excitement was so great had much difficulty reloading gun from trembling hands this taste long continued became very good shot when cambridge used practise throwing up gun shoulder before looking glass see threw it up straight another better plan was get friend wave about lighted candle then fire it with cap on nipple if aim was accurate little puff air would blow out candle explosion cap caused sharp crack was told tutor college remarked what an extraordinary thing it mr darwin seems spend hours cracking horse whip his room often hear crack when pass under his windows had many friends amongst schoolboys loved dearly think disposition was then very affectionate with respect science continued collecting minerals with much zeal but quite unscientifically all cared about was new named mineral hardly attempted classify them must have observed insects with little care when ten years old 1819 went three weeks plas edwards on sea coast wales was very much interested surprised seeing large black scarlet hemipterous insect many moths zygaena cicindela are not found shropshire almost made up mind begin collecting all insects could find dead on consulting sister concluded it was not right kill insects sake making collection from reading white s selborne took much pleasure watching habits birds even made notes on subject simplicity remember wondering why every gentleman did not become an ornithologist towards close school life brother worked hard chemistry made fair laboratory with proper apparatus tool house garden was allowed aid him servant most his experiments he made all gases many compounds read with great care several books on chemistry such henry parkes chemical catechism subject interested me greatly often used go on working till rather late night this was best part education school it showed me practically meaning experimental science fact worked chemistry somehow got known school it was an unprecedented fact was nicknamed gas was also once publicly rebuked by head master dr butler thus wasting time on such useless subjects he called me very unjustly poco curante did not understand what he meant it seemed me fearful reproach was doing no good school father wisely took me away rather earlier age than usual sent me oct 1825 edinburgh university with brother where stayed two years or sessions brother was completing his medical studies though do not believe he ever really intended practise was sent there commence them but soon after this period became convinced from various small circumstances father would leave me property enough subsist on with comfort though never imagined should so rich man am but belief was sufficient check any strenuous efforts learn medicine instruction edinburgh was altogether by lectures these were intolerably dull with exception those on chemistry by hope but mind there are no advantages many disadvantages lectures compared with reading dr duncan s lectures on materia medica 8 o clock on winter s morning are something fearful remember dr made his lectures on human anatomy dull he was himself subject disgusted me it has proved one greatest evils life was not urged practise dissection should soon have got over disgust practice would have been invaluable all future work this has been an irremediable evil incapacity draw also attended regularly clinical wards hospital cases distressed me good deal still have vivid pictures before me them but was not so foolish allow this lessen attendance cannot understand why this part medical course did not interest me greater degree during summer before coming edinburgh began attending poor people chiefly children women shrewsbury wrote down full an account could case with all symptoms read them aloud father suggested further inquiries advised me what medicines give made up myself one time had least dozen patients felt keen interest work father was by far best judge character ever knew declared should make successful physician meaning by this one would get many patients he maintained chief element success was exciting confidence but what he saw me convinced him should create confidence know not also attended on two occasions operating theatre hospital edinburgh saw two very bad operations one on child but rushed away before they were completed nor did ever attend again hardly any inducement would have been strong enough make me do so this being long before blessed days chloroform two cases fairly haunted me many long year brother stayed only one year university so during second year was left own resources this was an advantage became acquainted with several young men fond natural science one these was ainsworth afterwards published his travels assyria he was wernerian geologist knew little about many subjects dr coldstream was very different young man prim formal highly religious most kind hearted he afterwards published good zoological articles third young man was hardie would think have made good botanist but died early india lastly dr grant senior by several years but how became acquainted with him cannot remember he published first rate zoological papers but after coming london professor university college he did nothing more science fact has always been inexplicable me knew him he was dry formal manner with much enthusiasm beneath this outer crust he one day when were walking together burst forth high admiration lamarck his views on evolution listened silent astonishment far can judge without any effect on mind had previously read zoonomia grandfather similar views are maintained but without producing any effect on me nevertheless it probable hearing rather early life such views maintained praised have favoured upholding them under different form origin species this time admired greatly zoonomia but on reading it second time after an interval ten or fifteen years was much disappointed proportion speculation being so large facts given drs grant coldstream attended much marine zoology often accompanied former collect animals tidal pools dissected could also became friends with newhaven fishermen sometimes accompanied them when they trawled oysters thus got many specimens but from not having had any regular practice dissection from possessing only wretched microscope attempts were very poor nevertheless made one interesting little discovery read about beginning year 1826 short paper on subject before plinian society this was so called ova flustra had power independent movement by means cilia were fact larvae another short paper showed little globular bodies had been supposed young state fucus loreus were egg cases wormlike pontobdella muricata plinian society was encouraged believe founded by professor jameson it consisted students met an underground room university sake reading papers on natural science discussing them used regularly attend meetings had good effect on me stimulating zeal giving me new congenial acquaintances one evening poor young man got up after stammering prodigious length time blushing crimson he last slowly got out words mr president have forgotten what was going say poor fellow looked quite overwhelmed all members were so surprised no one could think word say cover his confusion papers were read little society were not printed so had not satisfaction seeing paper print but believe dr grant noticed small discovery his excellent memoir on flustra was also member royal medical society attended pretty regularly but subjects were exclusively medical did not much care about them much rubbish was talked there but there were good speakers best was present sir j kay shuttleworth dr grant took me occasionally meetings wernerian society where various papers on natural history were read discussed afterwards published transactions heard audubon deliver there interesting discourses on habits n american birds sneering somewhat unjustly waterton by way negro lived edinburgh had travelled with waterton gained his livelihood by stuffing birds he did excellently he gave me lessons payment used often sit with him he was very pleasant intelligent man mr leonard horner also took me once meeting royal society edinburgh where saw sir walter scott chair president he apologised meeting not feeling fitted such position looked him whole scene with awe reverence think it was owing this visit during youth having attended royal medical society felt honour being elected few years ago an honorary member both these societies more than any other similar honour if had been told time should one day have been thus honoured declare should have thought it ridiculous improbable if had been told should elected king england during second year edinburgh attended s lectures on geology zoology but they were incredibly dull sole effect they produced on me was determination never long lived read book on geology or any way study science yet feel sure was prepared philosophical treatment subject an old mr cotton shropshire knew good deal about rocks had pointed out me two or three years previously known large erratic boulder town shrewsbury called bell stone he told me there was no rock same kind nearer than cumberland or scotland he solemnly assured me world would come an end before any one would able explain how this stone came where it now lay this produced deep impression on me meditated over this wonderful stone so felt keenest delight when first read action icebergs transporting boulders gloried progress geology equally striking fact though now only sixty seven years old heard professor field lecture salisbury craigs discoursing on trapdyke with amygdaloidal margins strata indurated on each side with volcanic rocks all around us say it was fissure filled with sediment from above adding with sneer there were men maintained it had been injected from beneath molten condition when think this lecture do not wonder determined never attend geology from attending s lectures became acquainted with curator museum mr macgillivray afterwards published large excellent book on birds scotland had much interesting natural history talk with him he was very kind me he gave me rare shells time collected marine mollusca but with no great zeal summer vacations during these two years were wholly given up amusements though always had book hand read with interest during summer 1826 took long walking tour with two friends with knapsacks on backs through north wales walked thirty miles most days including one day ascent snowdon also went with sister riding tour north wales servant with saddle bags carrying clothes autumns were devoted shooting chiefly mr owen s woodhouse uncle jos s josiah wedgwood son founder etruria works maer zeal was so great used place shooting boots open by bed side when went bed so not lose half minute putting them on morning on one occasion reached distant part maer estate on 20th august black game shooting before could see then toiled on with game keeper whole day through thick heath young scotch firs kept an exact record every bird shot throughout whole season one day when shooting woodhouse with captain owen eldest son major hill his cousin afterwards lord berwick both liked very much thought myself shamefully used every time after had fired thought had killed bird one two acted if loading his gun cried out you must not count bird fired same time gamekeeper perceiving joke backed them up after hours they told me joke but it was no joke me had shot large number birds but did not know how many could not add them list used do by making knot piece string tied button hole this wicked friends had perceived how did enjoy shooting but think must have been half consciously ashamed zeal tried persuade myself shooting was almost an intellectual employment it required so much skill judge where find most game hunt dogs one autumnal visits maer 1827 was memorable from meeting there sir j mackintosh was best converser ever listened heard afterwards with glow pride he had said there something young man interests me this must have been chiefly due his perceiving listened with much interest everything he said was ignorant pig about his subjects history politics moral philosophy hear praise from an eminent person though no doubt apt or certain excite vanity think good young man it helps keep him right course visits maer during these two or three succeeding years were quite delightful independently autumnal shooting life there was perfectly free country was very pleasant walking or riding evening there was much very agreeable conversation not so personal it generally large family parties together with music summer whole family used often sit on steps old portico with flower garden front with steep wooded bank opposite house reflected lake with here there fish rising or water bird paddling about nothing has left more vivid picture on mind than these evenings maer was also attached greatly revered uncle jos he was silent reserved so rather awful man but he sometimes talked openly with me he was very type an upright man with clearest judgment do not believe any power on earth could have made him swerve an inch from what he considered right course used apply him mind known ode horace now forgotten by me words nec vultus tyranni etc come justum et tenacem propositi virum non civium ardor prava jubentium non vultus instantis tyranni mente quatit solida cambridge 1828 1831 after having spent two sessions edinburgh father perceived or he heard from sisters did not like thought being physician so he proposed should become clergyman he was very properly vehement against turning into an idle sporting man then seemed probable destination asked time consider from what little had heard or thought on subject had scruples about declaring belief all dogmas church england though otherwise liked thought being country clergyman accordingly read with care pearson on creed few other books on divinity did not then least doubt strict literal truth every word bible soon persuaded myself creed must fully accepted considering how fiercely have been attacked by orthodox it seems ludicrous once intended clergyman nor was this intention father s wish ever formerly given up but died natural death when on leaving cambridge joined beagle naturalist if phrenologists are trusted was fitted one respect clergyman few years ago secretaries german psychological society asked me earnestly by letter photograph myself time afterwards received proceedings one meetings it seemed shape head had been subject public discussion one speakers declared had bump reverence developed enough ten priests it was decided should clergyman it was necessary should go one english universities take degree but had never opened classical book since leaving school found dismay two intervening years had actually forgotten incredible it appear almost everything had learnt even few greek letters did not therefore proceed cambridge usual time october but worked with private tutor shrewsbury went cambridge after christmas vacation early 1828 soon recovered school standard knowledge could translate easy greek books such homer greek testament with moderate facility during three years spent cambridge time was wasted far academical studies were concerned completely edinburgh school attempted mathematics even went during summer 1828 with private tutor very dull man barmouth but got on very slowly work was repugnant me chiefly from not being able see any meaning early steps algebra this impatience was very foolish after years have deeply regretted did not proceed far enough least understand something great leading principles mathematics men thus endowed seem have an extra sense but do not believe should ever have succeeded beyond very low grade with respect classics did nothing except attend few compulsory college lectures attendance was almost nominal second year had work month or two pass little go did easily again last year worked with earnestness final degree b brushed up classics together with little algebra euclid latter gave me much pleasure it did school order pass b examination it was also necessary get up paley s evidences christianity his moral philosophy this was done thorough manner am convinced could have written out whole evidences with perfect correctness but not course clear language paley logic this book add his natural theology gave me much delight did euclid careful study these works without attempting learn any part by rote was only part academical course then felt still believe was least use me education mind did not time trouble myself about paley s premises taking these on trust was charmed convinced by long line argumentation by answering examination questions paley by doing euclid by not failing miserably classics gained good place among oi polloi or crowd men do not go honours oddly enough cannot remember how high stood memory fluctuates between fifth tenth or twelfth name on list tenth list january 1831 public lectures on several branches were given university attendance being quite voluntary but was so sickened with lectures edinburgh did not even attend sedgwick s eloquent interesting lectures had done so should probably have become geologist earlier than did attended however henslow s lectures on botany liked them much their extreme clearness admirable illustrations but did not study botany henslow used take his pupils including several older members university field excursions on foot or coaches distant places or barge down river lectured on rarer plants animals were observed these excursions were delightful although shall presently see there were redeeming features life cambridge time was sadly wasted there worse than wasted from passion shooting hunting when this failed riding across country got into sporting set including dissipated low minded young men used often dine together evening though these dinners often included men higher stamp sometimes drank too much with jolly singing playing cards afterwards know ought feel ashamed days evenings thus spent but friends were very pleasant were all highest spirits cannot help looking back these times with much pleasure but am glad think had many other friends widely different nature was very intimate with whitley rev c whitley hon canon durham formerly reader natural philosophy durham university was afterwards senior wrangler used continually take long walks together he inoculated me with taste pictures good engravings bought frequently went fitzwilliam gallery taste must have been fairly good certainly admired best pictures discussed with old curator read also with much interest sir joshua reynolds book this taste though not natural me lasted several years many pictures national gallery london gave me much pleasure sebastian del piombo exciting me sense sublimity also got into musical set believe by means warm hearted friend herbert late john maurice herbert county court judge cardiff monmouth circuit took high wrangler s degree from associating with these men hearing them play acquired strong taste music used very often time walks so hear on week days anthem king s college chapel this gave me intense pleasure so backbone would sometimes shiver am sure there was no affectation or mere imitation this taste used generally go by myself king s college sometimes hired chorister boys sing rooms nevertheless am so utterly destitute an ear cannot perceive discord or keep time hum tune correctly it mystery how could possibly have derived pleasure from music musical friends soon perceived state sometimes amused themselves by making me pass an examination consisted ascertaining how many tunes could recognise when they were played rather more quickly or slowly than usual god save king when thus played was sore puzzle there was another man with almost bad an ear had strange say he played little on flute once had triumph beating him one musical examinations but no pursuit cambridge was followed with nearly so much eagerness or gave me so much pleasure collecting beetles it was mere passion collecting did not dissect them rarely compared their external characters with published descriptions but got them named anyhow will give proof zeal one day on tearing off old bark saw two rare beetles seized one each hand then saw third new kind could not bear lose so popped one held right hand into mouth alas it ejected intensely acrid fluid burnt tongue so was forced spit beetle out was lost was third one was very successful collecting invented two new methods employed labourer scrape during winter moss off old trees place it large bag likewise collect rubbish bottom barges reeds are brought from fens thus got very rare species no poet ever felt more delighted seeing his first poem published than did seeing stephens illustrations british insects magic words captured by c darwin esq was introduced entomology by second cousin w darwin fox clever most pleasant man was then christ s college with became extremely intimate afterwards became acquainted went out collecting with albert way trinity after years became known archaeologist also with h thompson same college afterwards leading agriculturist chairman great railway member parliament it seems therefore taste collecting beetles indication future success life am surprised what an indelible impression many beetles caught cambridge have left on mind can remember exact appearance certain posts old trees banks where made good capture pretty panagaeus crux major was treasure those days here down saw beetle running across walk on picking it up instantly perceived it differed slightly from p crux major it turned out p quadripunctatus only variety or closely allied species differing from it very slightly outline had never seen those old days licinus alive an uneducated eye hardly differs from many black carabidous beetles but sons found here specimen instantly recognised it was new me yet had not looked british beetle last twenty years have not yet mentioned circumstance influenced whole career more than any other this was friendship with professor henslow before coming up cambridge had heard him from brother man knew every branch science was accordingly prepared reverence him he kept open house once every week when all undergraduates older members university were attached science used meet evening soon got through fox an invitation went there regularly before long became acquainted with henslow during latter half time cambridge took long walks with him on most days so was called by dons man walks with henslow evening was very often asked join his family dinner his knowledge was great botany entomology chemistry mineralogy geology his strongest taste was draw conclusions from long continued minute observations his judgment was excellent his whole mind balanced but do not suppose any one would say he possessed much original genius he was deeply religious so orthodox he told me one day he should grieved if single word thirty nine articles were altered his moral qualities were every way admirable he was free from every tinge vanity or other petty feeling never saw man thought so little about himself or his own concerns his temper was imperturbably good with most winning courteous manners yet have seen he could roused by any bad action warmest indignation prompt action once saw his company streets cambridge almost horrid scene could have been witnessed during french revolution two body snatchers had been arrested whilst being taken prison had been torn from constable by crowd roughest men dragged them by their legs along muddy stony road they were covered from head foot with mud their faces were bleeding either from having been kicked or from stones they looked like corpses but crowd was so dense got only few momentary glimpses wretched creatures never life have seen such wrath painted on man s face was shown by henslow this horrid scene he tried repeatedly penetrate mob but it was simply impossible he then rushed away mayor telling me not follow him but get more policemen forget issue except two men were got into prison without being killed henslow s benevolence was unbounded he proved by his many excellent schemes his poor parishioners when after years he held living hitcham intimacy with such man ought have been hope was an inestimable benefit cannot resist mentioning trifling incident showed his kind consideration whilst examining pollen grains on damp surface saw tubes exserted instantly rushed off communicate surprising discovery him now do not suppose any other professor botany could have helped laughing coming such hurry make such communication but he agreed how interesting phenomenon was explained its meaning but made me clearly understand how it was known so left him not least mortified but pleased having discovered myself so remarkable fact but determined not such hurry again communicate discoveries dr whewell was one older distinguished men sometimes visited henslow on several occasions walked home with him night next sir j mackintosh he was best converser on grave subjects ever listened leonard jenyns known soame jenyns was cousin mr jenyns father afterwards published good essays natural history mr jenyns now blomefield described fish zoology beagle author long series papers chiefly zoological often stayed with henslow was his brother law visited him his parsonage on borders fens swaffham bulbeck had many good walk talk with him about natural history became also acquainted with several other men older than me did not care much about science but were friends henslow one was scotchman brother sir alexander ramsay tutor jesus college he was delightful man but did not live many years another was mr dawes afterwards dean hereford famous his success education poor these men others same standing together with henslow used sometimes take distant excursions into country was allowed join they were most agreeable looking back infer there must have been something me little superior common run youths otherwise above mentioned men so much older than me higher academical position would never have allowed me associate with them certainly was not aware any such superiority remember one sporting friends turner saw me work with beetles saying should day fellow royal society notion seemed me preposterous during last year cambridge read with care profound interest humboldt s personal narrative this work sir j herschel s introduction study natural philosophy stirred up me burning zeal add even most humble contribution noble structure natural science no one or dozen other books influenced me nearly so much these two copied out from humboldt long passages about teneriffe read them aloud on one above mentioned excursions think henslow ramsay dawes on previous occasion had talked about glories teneriffe party declared they would endeavour go there but think they were only half earnest was however quite earnest got an introduction merchant london enquire about ships but scheme was course knocked on head by voyage beagle summer vacations were given up collecting beetles reading short tours autumn whole time was devoted shooting chiefly woodhouse maer sometimes with young eyton eyton upon whole three years spent cambridge were most joyful happy life was then excellent health almost always high spirits had first come up cambridge christmas was forced keep two terms after passing final examination commencement 1831 henslow then persuaded me begin study geology therefore on return shropshire examined sections coloured map parts round shrewsbury professor sedgwick intended visit north wales beginning august pursue his famous geological investigations amongst older rocks henslow asked him allow me accompany him connection with this tour father used tell story about sedgwick they had started from their inn one morning had walked mile or two when sedgwick suddenly stopped vowed he would return being certain damned scoundrel waiter had not given chambermaid sixpence intrusted him purpose he was ultimately persuaded give up project seeing there was no reason suspecting waiter especial perfidy f d accordingly he came slept father s house short conversation with him during this evening produced strong impression on mind whilst examining an old gravel pit near shrewsbury labourer told me he had found it large worn tropical volute shell such seen on chimney pieces cottages he would not sell shell was convinced he had really found it pit told sedgwick fact he once said no doubt truly it must have been thrown away by one into pit but then added if really embedded there it would greatest misfortune geology it would overthrow all know about superficial deposits midland counties these gravel beds belong fact glacial period after years found them broken arctic shells but was then utterly astonished sedgwick not being delighted so wonderful fact tropical shell being found near surface middle england nothing before had ever made me thoroughly realise though had read various scientific books science consists grouping facts so general laws or conclusions drawn from them next morning started llangollen conway bangor capel curig this tour was decided use teaching me little how make out geology country sedgwick often sent me on line parallel his telling me bring back specimens rocks mark stratification on map have little doubt he did this good was too ignorant have aided him on this tour had striking instance how easy it overlook phenomena however conspicuous before they have been observed by any one spent many hours cwm idwal examining all rocks with extreme care sedgwick was anxious find fossils them but neither us saw trace wonderful glacial phenomena all around us did not notice plainly scored rocks perched boulders lateral terminal moraines yet these phenomena are so conspicuous declared paper published many years afterwards philosophical magazine philosophical magazine 1842 house burnt down by fire did not tell its story more plainly than did this valley if it had still been filled by glacier phenomena would have been less distinct than they now are capel curig left sedgwick went straight line by compass map across mountains barmouth never following any track unless it coincided with course thus came on strange wild places enjoyed much this manner travelling visited barmouth see cambridge friends were reading there thence returned shrewsbury maer shooting time should have thought myself mad give up first days partridge shooting geology or any other science voyage beagle from december 27 1831 october 2 1836 on returning home from short geological tour north wales found letter from henslow informing me captain fitz roy was willing give up part his own cabin any young man would volunteer go with him without pay naturalist voyage beagle have given believe ms journal an account all circumstances then occurred will here only say was instantly eager accept offer but father strongly objected adding words fortunate me if you can find any man common sense advises you go will give consent so wrote evening refused offer on next morning went maer ready september 1st whilst out shooting uncle josiah wedgwood sent me offering drive me over shrewsbury talk with father uncle thought it would wise me accept offer father always maintained he was one most sensible men world he once consented kindest manner had been rather extravagant cambridge console father said should deuced clever spend more than allowance whilst on board beagle but he answered with smile but they tell me you are very clever next day started cambridge see henslow thence london see fitz roy all was soon arranged afterwards on becoming very intimate with fitz roy heard had run very narrow risk being rejected on account shape nose he was an ardent disciple lavater was convinced he could judge man s character by outline his features he doubted whether any one with nose could possess sufficient energy determination voyage but think he was afterwards satisfied nose had spoken falsely fitz roy s character was singular one with very many noble features he was devoted his duty generous fault bold determined indomitably energetic an ardent friend all under his sway he would undertake any sort trouble assist those he thought deserved assistance he was handsome man strikingly like gentleman with highly courteous manners resembled those his maternal uncle famous lord castlereagh was told by minister rio nevertheless he must have inherited much his appearance from charles ii dr wallich gave me collection photographs he had made was struck with resemblance one fitz roy on looking name found it ch e sobieski stuart count d albanie descendant same monarch fitz roy s temper was most unfortunate one it was usually worst early morning with his eagle eye he could generally detect something amiss about ship was then unsparing his blame he was very kind me but was man very difficult live with on intimate terms necessarily followed from messing by ourselves same cabin had several quarrels instance early voyage bahia brazil he defended praised slavery abominated told me he had just visited great slave owner had called up many his slaves asked them whether they were happy whether they wished free all answered no then asked him perhaps with sneer whether he thought answer slaves presence their master was worth anything this made him excessively angry he said doubted his word could not live any longer together thought should have been compelled leave ship but soon news spread it did quickly captain sent first lieutenant assuage his anger by abusing me was deeply gratified by receiving an invitation from all gun room officers mess with them but after few hours fitz roy showed his usual magnanimity by sending an officer me with an apology request would continue live with him his character was several respects one most noble have ever known voyage beagle has been by far most important event life has determined whole career yet it depended on so small circumstance uncle offering drive me thirty miles shrewsbury few uncles would have done on such trifle shape nose have always felt owe voyage first real training or education mind was led attend closely several branches natural history thus powers observation were improved though they were always fairly developed investigation geology all places visited was far more important reasoning here comes into play on first examining new district nothing can appear more hopeless than chaos rocks but by recording stratification nature rocks fossils many points always reasoning predicting what will found elsewhere light soon begins dawn on district structure whole becomes more or less intelligible had brought with me first volume lyell s principles geology studied attentively book was highest service me many ways very first place examined namely st jago cape de verde islands showed me clearly wonderful superiority lyell s manner treating geology compared with any other author whose works had with me or ever afterwards read another occupations was collecting animals all classes briefly describing roughly dissecting many marine ones but from not being able draw from not having sufficient anatomical knowledge great pile ms made during voyage has proved almost useless thus lost much time with exception spent acquiring knowledge crustaceans this was service when after years undertook monograph cirripedia during part day wrote journal took much pains describing carefully vividly all had seen this was good practice journal served also part letters home portions were sent england whenever there was an opportunity above various special studies were however no importance compared with habit energetic industry concentrated attention whatever was engaged then acquired everything about thought or read was made bear directly on what had seen or was likely see this habit mind was continued during five years voyage feel sure it was this training has enabled me do whatever have done science looking backwards can now perceive how love science gradually preponderated over every other taste during first two years old passion shooting survived nearly full force shot myself all birds animals collection but gradually gave up gun more more finally altogether servant shooting interfered with work more especially with making out geological structure country discovered though unconsciously insensibly pleasure observing reasoning was much higher one than skill sport mind became developed through pursuits during voyage rendered probable by remark made by father was most acute observer ever saw sceptical disposition far from being believer phrenology on first seeing me after voyage he turned round sisters exclaimed why shape his head quite altered return voyage on september 11th 1831 paid flying visit with fitz roy beagle plymouth thence shrewsbury wish father sisters long farewell on october 24th took up residence plymouth remained there until december 27th when beagle finally left shores england her circumnavigation world made two earlier attempts sail but were driven back each time by heavy gales these two months plymouth were most miserable ever spent though exerted myself various ways was out spirits thought leaving all family friends so long time weather seemed me inexpressibly gloomy was also troubled with palpitation pain about heart like many young ignorant man especially one with smattering medical knowledge was convinced had heart disease did not consult any doctor fully expected hear verdict was not fit voyage was resolved go all hazards need not here refer events voyage where went what did have given sufficiently full account published journal glories vegetation tropics rise before mind present time more vividly than anything else though sense sublimity great deserts patagonia forest clad mountains tierra del fuego excited me has left an indelible impression on mind sight naked savage his native land an event can never forgotten many excursions on horseback through wild countries or boats lasted several weeks were deeply interesting their discomfort degree danger were time hardly drawback none all afterwards also reflect with high satisfaction on scientific work such solving problem coral islands making out geological structure certain islands instance st helena nor must pass over discovery singular relations animals plants inhabiting several islands galapagos archipelago all them inhabitants south america far can judge myself worked utmost during voyage from mere pleasure investigation from strong desire add few facts great mass facts natural science but was also ambitious take fair place among scientific men whether more ambitious or less so than most fellow workers can form no opinion geology st jago very striking yet simple stream lava formerly flowed over bed sea formed triturated recent shells corals it has baked into hard white rock since then whole island has been upheaved but line white rock revealed me new important fact namely there had been afterwards subsidence round craters had since been action had poured forth lava it then first dawned on me perhaps write book on geology various countries visited this made me thrill with delight was memorable hour me how distinctly can call mind low cliff lava beneath rested with sun glaring hot few strange desert plants growing near with living corals tidal pools feet later voyage fitz roy asked me read journal declared it would worth publishing so here was second book prospect towards close voyage received letter whilst ascension sisters told me sedgwick had called on father said should take place among leading scientific men could not time understand how he could have learnt anything proceedings but heard believe afterwards henslow had read letters wrote him before philosophical society cambridge read meeting held november 16 1835 printed pamphlet 31 pages distribution among members society had printed them private distribution collection fossil bones had been sent henslow also excited considerable attention amongst palaeontologists after reading this letter clambered over mountains ascension with bounding step made volcanic rocks resound under geological hammer all this shows how ambitious was but think can say with truth after years though cared highest degree approbation such men lyell hooker were friends did not care much about general public do not mean say favourable review or large sale books did not please me greatly but pleasure was fleeting one am sure have never turned one inch out course gain fame from return england october 2 1836 marriage january 29 1839 these two years three months were most active ones ever spent though was occasionally unwell so lost time after going backwards forwards several times between shrewsbury maer cambridge london settled lodgings cambridge fitzwilliam street on december 13th where all collections were under care henslow stayed here three months got minerals rocks examined by aid professor miller began preparing journal travels was not hard work ms journal had been written with care chief labour was making an abstract more interesting scientific results sent also request lyell short account observations on elevation coast chile geological society geolog soc proc ii 1838 pages 446 449 on march 7th 1837 took lodgings great marlborough street london remained there nearly two years until was married during these two years finished journal read several papers before geological society began preparing ms geological observations arranged publication zoology voyage beagle july opened first note book facts relation origin species about had long reflected never ceased working next twenty years during these two years also went little into society acted one honorary secretaries geological society saw great deal lyell one his chief characteristics was his sympathy with work others was much astonished delighted interest he showed when on return england explained him views on coral reefs this encouraged me greatly his advice example had much influence on me during this time saw also good deal robert brown used often call sit with him during his breakfast on sunday mornings he poured forth rich treasure curious observations acute remarks but they almost always related minute points he never with me discussed large or general questions science during these two years took several short excursions relaxation one longer one parallel roads glen roy an account was published philosophical transactions 1839 pages 39 82 this paper was great failure am ashamed it having been deeply impressed with what had seen elevation land south america attributed parallel lines action sea but had give up this view when agassiz propounded his glacier lake theory because no other explanation was possible under then state knowledge argued favour sea action error has been good lesson me never trust science principle exclusion was not able work all day science read good deal during these two years on various subjects including metaphysical books but was not fitted such studies about this time took much delight wordsworth s coleridge s poetry can boast read excursion twice through formerly milton s paradise lost had been chief favourite excursions during voyage beagle when could take only single volume always chose milton from marriage january 29 1839 residence upper gower street leaving london settling down september 14 1842 after speaking his happy married life his children he continues during three years eight months whilst resided london did less scientific work though worked hard possibly could than during any other equal length time life this was owing frequently recurring unwellness one long serious illness greater part time when could do anything was devoted work on coral reefs had begun before marriage last proof sheet was corrected on 6th 1842 this book though small one cost me twenty months hard work had read every work on islands pacific consult many charts it was thought highly by scientific men theory therein given think now established no other work mine was begun so deductive spirit this whole theory was thought out on west coast south america before had seen true coral reef had therefore only verify extend views by careful examination living reefs but it should observed had during two previous years been incessantly attending effects on shores south america intermittent elevation land together with denudation deposition sediment this necessarily led me reflect much on effects subsidence it was easy replace imagination continued deposition sediment by upward growth corals do this was form theory formation barrier reefs atolls besides work on coral reefs during residence london read before geological society papers on erratic boulders south america geolog soc proc iii 1842 on earthquakes geolog trans v 1840 on formation by agency earth worms mould geolog soc proc ii 1838 also continued superintend publication zoology voyage beagle nor did ever intermit collecting facts bearing on origin species could sometimes do this when could do nothing else from illness summer 1842 was stronger than had been time took little tour by myself north wales sake observing effects old glaciers formerly filled all larger valleys published short account what saw philosophical magazine philosophical magazine 1842 this excursion interested me greatly it was last time was ever strong enough climb mountains or take long walks such are necessary geological work during early part life london was strong enough go into general society saw good deal several scientific men other more or less distinguished men will give impressions with respect them though have little say worth saying saw more lyell than any other man both before after marriage his mind was characterised it appeared me by clearness caution sound judgment good deal originality when made any remark him on geology he never rested until he saw whole case clearly often made me see it more clearly than had done before he would advance all possible objections suggestion even after these were exhausted would long remain dubious second characteristic was his hearty sympathy with work other scientific men slight repetition here observable accounted by notes on lyell etc having been added april 1881 few years after rest recollections were written on return from voyage beagle explained him views on coral reefs differed from his was greatly surprised encouraged by vivid interest he showed his delight science was ardent he felt keenest interest future progress mankind he was very kind hearted thoroughly liberal his religious beliefs or rather disbeliefs but he was strong theist his candour was highly remarkable he exhibited this by becoming convert descent theory though he had gained much fame by opposing lamarck s views this after he had grown old he reminded me had many years before said him when discussing opposition old school geologists his new views what good thing it would if every scientific man was die when sixty years old afterwards he would sure oppose all new doctrines but he hoped now he allowed live science geology enormously indebted lyell more so believe than any other man ever lived when was starting on voyage beagle sagacious henslow like all other geologists believed time successive cataclysms advised me get study first volume principles had then just been published but on no account accept views therein advocated how differently would anyone now speak principles am proud remember first place namely st jago cape de verde archipelago geologised convinced me infinite superiority lyell s views over those advocated any other work known me powerful effects lyell s works could formerly plainly seen different progress science france england present total oblivion elie de beaumont s wild hypotheses such his craters elevation lines elevation latter hypothesis heard sedgwick geological society lauding skies largely attributed lyell saw good deal robert brown facile princeps botanicorum he was called by humboldt he seemed me chiefly remarkable minuteness his observations their perfect accuracy his knowledge was extraordinarily great much died with him owing his excessive fear ever making mistake he poured out his knowledge me most unreserved manner yet was strangely jealous on points called on him two or three times before voyage beagle on one occasion he asked me look through microscope describe what saw this did believe now it was marvellous currents protoplasm vegetable cell then asked him what had seen but he answered me little secret he was capable most generous actions when old much out health quite unfit any exertion he daily visited hooker told me an old man servant lived distance he supported read aloud him this enough make up any degree scientific penuriousness or jealousy here mention few other eminent men have occasionally seen but have little say about them worth saying felt high reverence sir j herschel was delighted dine with him his charming house cape good hope afterwards his london house saw him also on few other occasions he never talked much but every word he uttered was worth listening once met breakfast sir r murchison s house illustrious humboldt honoured me by expressing wish see me was little disappointed with great man but anticipations probably were too high can remember nothing distinctly about interview except humboldt was very cheerful talked much reminds me buckle once met hensleigh wedgwood s was very glad learn from him his system collecting facts he told me he bought all books he read made full index each facts he thought prove serviceable him he could always remember what book he had read anything his memory was wonderful asked him how first he could judge what facts would serviceable he answered he did not know but sort instinct guided him from this habit making indices he was enabled give astonishing number references on all sorts subjects found his history civilisation this book thought most interesting read it twice but doubt whether his generalisations are worth anything buckle was great talker listened him saying hardly word nor indeed could have done so he left no gaps when mrs farrer began sing jumped up said must listen her after had moved away he turned around friend said was overheard by brother mr darwin s books are much better than his conversation other great literary men once met sydney smith dean milman s house there was something inexplicably amusing every word he uttered perhaps this was partly due expectation being amused he was talking about lady cork was then extremely old this was lady he said was once so much affected by one his charity sermons she borrowed guinea from friend put plate he now said it generally believed dear old friend lady cork has been overlooked he said this such manner no one could moment doubt he meant his dear old friend had been overlooked by devil how he managed express this know not likewise once met macaulay lord stanhope s historian s house there was only one other man dinner had grand opportunity hearing him converse he was very agreeable he did not talk all too much nor indeed could such man talk too much long he allowed others turn stream his conversation this he did allow lord stanhope once gave me curious little proof accuracy fulness macaulay s memory many historians used often meet lord stanhope s house discussing various subjects they would sometimes differ from macaulay formerly they often referred book see was right but latterly lord stanhope noticed no historian ever took this trouble whatever macaulay said was final on another occasion met lord stanhope s house one his parties historians other literary men amongst them were motley grote after luncheon walked about chevening park nearly an hour with grote was much interested by his conversation pleased by simplicity absence all pretension his manners long ago dined occasionally with old earl father historian he was strange man but what little knew him liked much he was frank genial pleasant he had strongly marked features with brown complexion his clothes when saw him were all brown he seemed believe everything was others utterly incredible he said one day me why don t you give up your fiddle faddle geology zoology turn occult sciences historian then lord mahon seemed shocked such speech me his charming wife much amused last man will mention carlyle seen by me several times brother s house two or three times own house his talk was very racy interesting just like his writings but he sometimes went on too long on same subject remember funny dinner brother s where amongst few others were babbage lyell both liked talk carlyle however silenced every one by haranguing during whole dinner on advantages silence after dinner babbage his grimmest manner thanked carlyle his very interesting lecture on silence carlyle sneered almost every one one day house he called grote s history fetid quagmire with nothing spiritual about it always thought until his reminiscences appeared his sneers were partly jokes but this now seems rather doubtful his expression was depressed almost despondent yet benevolent man it notorious how heartily he laughed believe his benevolence was real though stained by not little jealousy no one can doubt about his extraordinary power drawing pictures things men far more vivid it appears me than any drawn by macaulay whether his pictures men were true ones another question he has been all powerful impressing grand moral truths on minds men on other hand his views about slavery were revolting his eyes was right his mind seemed me very narrow one even if all branches science he despised are excluded it astonishing me kingsley should have spoken him man fitted advance science he laughed scorn idea mathematician such whewell could judge maintained he could goethe s views on light he thought it most ridiculous thing any one should care whether glacier moved little quicker or little slower or moved all far could judge never met man with mind so ill adapted scientific research whilst living london attended regularly could meetings several scientific societies acted secretary geological society but such attendance ordinary society suited health so badly resolved live country both preferred have never repented residence down from september 14 1842 present time 1876 after several fruitless searches surrey elsewhere found this house purchased it was pleased with diversified appearance vegetation proper chalk district so unlike what had been accustomed midland counties still more pleased with extreme quietness rusticity place it not however quite so retired place writer german periodical makes it says house can approached only by mule track fixing ourselves here has answered admirably one way did not anticipate namely by being very convenient frequent visits from children few persons can have lived more retired life than have done besides short visits houses relations occasionally seaside or elsewhere have gone nowhere during first part residence went little into society received few friends here but health almost always suffered from excitement violent shivering vomiting attacks being thus brought on have therefore been compelled many years give up all dinner parties this has been somewhat deprivation me such parties always put me into high spirits from same cause have been able invite here very few scientific acquaintances chief enjoyment sole employment throughout life has been scientific work excitement from such work makes me time forget or drives quite away daily discomfort have therefore nothing record during rest life except publication several books perhaps few details how they arose worth giving several publications early part 1844 observations on volcanic islands visited during voyage beagle were published 1845 took much pains correcting new edition journal researches was originally published 1839 part fitz roy s work success this first literary child always tickles vanity more than any other books even this day it sells steadily england united states has been translated second time into german into french other languages this success book travels especially scientific one so many years after its first publication surprising ten thousand copies have been sold england second edition 1846 geological observations on south america were published record little diary have always kept three geological books coral reefs included consumed four half years steady work now it ten years since return england how much time have lost by illness have nothing say about these three books except surprise new editions have lately been called geological observations 2nd edit 1876 coral reefs 2nd edit 1874 october 1846 began work on cirripedia when on coast chile found most curious form burrowed into shells concholepas differed so much from all other cirripedes had form new sub order its sole reception lately an allied burrowing genus has been found on shores portugal understand structure new cirripede had examine dissect many common forms this gradually led me on take up whole group worked steadily on this subject next eight years ultimately published two thick volumes published by ray society describing all known living species two thin quartos on extinct species do not doubt sir e lytton bulwer had me his mind when he introduced one his novels professor long had written two huge volumes on limpets although was employed during eight years on this work yet record diary about two years out this time was lost by illness on this account went 1848 months malvern hydropathic treatment did me much good so on return home was able resume work so much was out health when dear father died on november 13th 1848 was unable attend his funeral or act one his executors work on cirripedia possesses think considerable value besides describing several new remarkable forms made out homologies various parts discovered cementing apparatus though blundered dreadfully about cement glands lastly proved existence certain genera minute males complemental parasitic on hermaphrodites this latter discovery has last been fully confirmed though one time german writer was pleased attribute whole account fertile imagination cirripedes form highly varying difficult group species class work was considerable use me when had discuss origin species principles natural classification nevertheless doubt whether work was worth consumption so much time from september 1854 devoted whole time arranging huge pile notes observing experimenting relation transmutation species during voyage beagle had been deeply impressed by discovering pampean formation great fossil animals covered with armour like on existing armadillos secondly by manner closely allied animals replace one another proceeding southwards over continent thirdly by south american character most productions galapagos archipelago more especially by manner they differ slightly on each island group none islands appearing very ancient geological sense it was evident such facts these many others could only explained on supposition species gradually become modified subject haunted me but it was equally evident neither action surrounding conditions nor will organisms especially case plants could account innumerable cases organisms every kind are beautifully adapted their habits life instance woodpecker or tree frog climb trees or seed dispersal by hooks or plumes had always been much struck by such adaptations until these could explained it seemed me almost useless endeavour prove by indirect evidence species have been modified after return england it appeared me by following example lyell geology by collecting all facts bore any way on variation animals plants under domestication nature light perhaps thrown on whole subject first note book was opened july 1837 worked on true baconian principles without any theory collected facts on wholesale scale more especially with respect domesticated productions by printed enquiries by conversation with skilful breeders gardeners by extensive reading when see list books all kinds read abstracted including whole series journals transactions am surprised industry soon perceived selection was keystone man s success making useful races animals plants but how selection could applied organisms living state nature remained time mystery me october 1838 fifteen months after had begun systematic enquiry happened read amusement malthus on population being prepared appreciate struggle existence everywhere goes on from long continued observation habits animals plants it once struck me under these circumstances favourable variations would tend preserved unfavourable ones destroyed result this would formation new species here then had last got theory by work but was so anxious avoid prejudice determined not time write even briefest sketch it june 1842 first allowed myself satisfaction writing very brief abstract theory pencil 35 pages this was enlarged during summer 1844 into one 230 pages had fairly copied out still possess but time overlooked one problem great importance it astonishing me except on principle columbus his egg how could have overlooked it its solution this problem tendency organic beings descended from same stock diverge character they become modified they have diverged greatly obvious from manner species all kinds can classed under genera genera under families families under sub orders so forth can remember very spot road whilst carriage when joy solution occurred me this was long after had come down solution believe modified offspring all dominant increasing forms tend become adapted many highly diversified places economy nature early 1856 lyell advised me write out views pretty fully began once do so on scale three or four times extensive was afterwards followed origin species yet it was only an abstract materials had collected got through about half work on this scale but plans were overthrown early summer 1858 mr wallace was then malay archipelago sent me an essay on tendency varieties depart indefinitely from original type this essay contained exactly same theory mine mr wallace expressed wish if thought his essay should sent it lyell perusal circumstances under consented request lyell hooker allow an abstract from ms together with letter asa gray dated september 5 1857 published same time with wallace s essay are given journal proceedings linnean society 1858 page 45 was first very unwilling consent thought mr wallace consider doing so unjustifiable did not then know how generous noble was his disposition extract from ms letter asa gray had neither been intended publication were badly written mr wallace s essay on other hand was admirably expressed quite clear nevertheless joint productions excited very little attention only published notice them can remember was by professor haughton dublin whose verdict was all was new them was false what was true was old this shows how necessary it any new view should explained considerable length order arouse public attention september 1858 set work by strong advice lyell hooker prepare volume on transmutation species but was often interrupted by ill health short visits dr lane s delightful hydropathic establishment moor park abstracted ms begun on much larger scale 1856 completed volume on same reduced scale it cost me thirteen months ten days hard labour it was published under title origin species november 1859 though considerably added corrected later editions it has remained substantially same book it no doubt chief work life it was from first highly successful first small edition 1250 copies was sold on day publication second edition 3000 copies soon afterwards sixteen thousand copies have now 1876 been sold england considering how stiff book it this large sale it has been translated into almost every european tongue even into such languages spanish bohemian polish russian it has also according miss bird been translated into japanese miss bird mistaken learn from prof mitsukuri f d there much studied even an essay hebrew has appeared on it showing theory contained old testament reviews were very numerous time collected all appeared on origin on related books these amount excluding newspaper reviews 265 but after time gave up attempt despair many separate essays books on subject have appeared germany catalogue or bibliography on darwinismus has appeared every year or two success origin think attributed large part having long before written two condensed sketches having finally abstracted much larger manuscript was itself an abstract by this means was enabled select more striking facts conclusions had also during many years followed golden rule namely whenever published fact new observation or thought came across me was opposed general results make memorandum it without fail once had found by experience such facts thoughts were far more apt escape from memory than favourable ones owing this habit very few objections were raised against views had not least noticed attempted answer it has sometimes been said success origin proved subject was air or men s minds were prepared it do not think this strictly true occasionally sounded not few naturalists never happened come across single one seemed doubt about permanence species even lyell hooker though they would listen with interest me never seemed agree tried once or twice explain able men what meant by natural selection but signally failed what believe was strictly true innumerable observed facts were stored minds naturalists ready take their proper places soon any theory would receive them was sufficiently explained another element success book was its moderate size this owe appearance mr wallace s essay had published on scale began write 1856 book would have been four or five times large origin very few would have had patience read it gained much by delay publishing from about 1839 when theory was clearly conceived 1859 lost nothing by it cared very little whether men attributed most originality me or wallace his essay no doubt aided reception theory was forestalled only one important point vanity has always made me regret namely explanation by means glacial period presence same species plants few animals on distant mountain summits arctic regions this view pleased me so much wrote it out extenso believe it was read by hooker years before e forbes published his celebrated memoir geolog survey mem 1846 on subject very few points differed still think was right have never course alluded print having independently worked out this view hardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when was work on origin explanation wide difference many classes between embryo adult animal close resemblance embryos within same class no notice this point was taken far remember early reviews origin recollect expressing surprise on this head letter asa gray within late years several reviewers have given whole credit fritz muller hackel undoubtedly have worked it out much more fully respects more correctly than did had materials whole chapter on subject ought have made discussion longer it clear failed impress readers he succeeds doing so deserves opinion all credit this leads me remark have almost always been treated honestly by reviewers passing over those without scientific knowledge not worthy notice views have often been grossly misrepresented bitterly opposed ridiculed but this has been generally done believe good faith on whole do not doubt works have been over over again greatly overpraised rejoice have avoided controversies this owe lyell many years ago reference geological works strongly advised me never get entangled controversy it rarely did any good caused miserable loss time temper whenever have found out have blundered or work has been imperfect when have been contemptuously criticised even when have been overpraised so have felt mortified it has been greatest comfort say hundreds times myself have worked hard could no man can do more than this remember when good success bay tierra del fuego thinking believe wrote home effect could not employ life better than adding little natural science this have done best abilities critics say what they like but they cannot destroy this conviction during two last months 1859 was fully occupied preparing second edition origin by an enormous correspondence on january 1st 1860 began arranging notes work on variation animals plants under domestication but it was not published until beginning 1868 delay having been caused partly by frequent illnesses one lasted seven months partly by being tempted publish on other subjects time interested me more on 15th 1862 little book on fertilisation orchids cost me ten months work was published most facts had been slowly accumulated during several previous years during summer 1839 believe during previous summer was led attend cross fertilisation flowers by aid insects from having come conclusion speculations on origin species crossing played an important part keeping specific forms constant attended subject more or less during every subsequent summer interest it was greatly enhanced by having procured read november 1841 through advice robert brown copy c k sprengel s wonderful book das entdeckte geheimniss der natur years before 1862 had specially attended fertilisation british orchids it seemed me best plan prepare complete treatise on this group plants could rather than utilise great mass matter had slowly collected with respect other plants resolve proved wise one since appearance book surprising number papers separate works on fertilisation all kinds flowers have appeared these are far better done than could possibly have effected merits poor old sprengel so long overlooked are now fully recognised many years after his death during same year published journal linnean society paper on two forms or dimorphic condition primula during next five years five other papers on dimorphic trimorphic plants do not think anything scientific life has given me so much satisfaction making out meaning structure these plants had noticed 1838 or 1839 dimorphism linum flavum had first thought it was merely case unmeaning variability but on examining common species primula found two forms were much too regular constant thus viewed therefore became almost convinced common cowslip primrose were on high road become dioecious short pistil one form short stamens other form were tending towards abortion plants were therefore subjected under this point view trial but soon flowers with short pistils fertilised with pollen from short stamens were found yield more seeds than any other four possible unions abortion theory was knocked on head after additional experiment it became evident two forms though both were perfect hermaphrodites bore almost same relation one another do two sexes an ordinary animal with lythrum have still more wonderful case three forms standing similar relation one another afterwards found offspring from union two plants belonging same forms presented close curious analogy with hybrids from union two distinct species autumn 1864 finished long paper on climbing plants sent it linnean society writing this paper cost me four months but was so unwell when received proof sheets was forced leave them very badly often obscurely expressed paper was little noticed but when 1875 it was corrected published separate book it sold was led take up this subject by reading short paper by asa gray published 1858 he sent me seeds on raising plants was so much fascinated perplexed by revolving movements tendrils stems movements are really very simple though appearing first sight very complex procured various other kinds climbing plants studied whole subject was all more attracted it from not being all satisfied with explanation henslow gave us his lectures about twining plants namely they had natural tendency grow up spire this explanation proved quite erroneous adaptations displayed by climbing plants are beautiful those orchids ensuring cross fertilisation variation animals plants under domestication was begun already stated beginning 1860 but was not published until beginning 1868 it was big book cost me four years two months hard labour it gives all observations an immense number facts collected from various sources about domestic productions second volume causes laws variation inheritance etc are discussed far present state knowledge permits towards end work give abused hypothesis pangenesis an unverified hypothesis little or no value but if anyone should hereafter led make observations by such hypothesis could established shall have done good service an astonishing number isolated facts can thus connected together rendered intelligible 1875 second largely corrected edition cost me good deal labour was brought out descent man was published february 1871 soon had become year 1837 or 1838 convinced species were mutable productions could not avoid belief man must come under same law accordingly collected notes on subject own satisfaction not long time with any intention publishing although origin species derivation any particular species never discussed yet thought it best order no honourable man should accuse me concealing views add by work light would thrown on origin man his history it would have been useless injurious success book have paraded without giving any evidence conviction with respect his origin but when found many naturalists fully accepted doctrine evolution species it seemed me advisable work up such notes possessed publish special treatise on origin man was more glad do so it gave me an opportunity fully discussing sexual selection subject had always greatly interested me this subject variation domestic productions together with causes laws variation inheritance intercrossing plants are sole subjects have been able write about full so use all materials have collected descent man took me three years write but then usual this time was lost by ill health was consumed by preparing new editions other minor works second largely corrected edition descent appeared 1874 book on expression emotions men animals was published autumn 1872 had intended give only chapter on subject descent man but soon began put notes together saw it would require separate treatise first child was born on december 27th 1839 once commenced make notes on first dawn various expressions he exhibited felt convinced even this early period most complex fine shades expression must all have had gradual natural origin during summer following year 1840 read sir c bell s admirable work on expression this greatly increased interest felt subject though could not all agree with his belief various muscles had been specially created sake expression from this time forward occasionally attended subject both with respect man domesticated animals book sold largely 5267 copies having been disposed on day publication summer 1860 was idling resting near hartfield where two species drosera abound noticed numerous insects had been entrapped by leaves carried home plants on giving them insects saw movements tentacles this made me think it probable insects were caught special purpose fortunately crucial test occurred me placing large number leaves various nitrogenous non nitrogenous fluids equal density soon found former alone excited energetic movements it was obvious here was fine new field investigation during subsequent years whenever had leisure pursued experiments book on insectivorous plants was published july 1875 sixteen years after first observations delay this case with all other books has been great advantage me man after long interval can criticise his own work almost if it were another person fact plant should secrete when properly excited fluid containing an acid ferment closely analogous digestive fluid an animal was certainly remarkable discovery during this autumn 1876 shall publish on effects cross self fertilisation vegetable kingdom this book will form complement on fertilisation orchids showed how perfect were means cross fertilisation here shall how important are results was led make during eleven years numerous experiments recorded this volume by mere accidental observation indeed it required accident repeated before attention was thoroughly aroused remarkable fact seedlings self fertilised parentage are inferior even first generation height vigour seedlings cross fertilised parentage hope also republish revised edition book on orchids hereafter papers on dimorphic trimorphic plants together with additional observations on allied points never have had time arrange strength will then probably exhausted shall ready exclaim nunc dimittis written 1st 1881 effects cross self fertilisation was published autumn 1876 results there arrived explain believe endless wonderful contrivances transportal pollen from one plant another same species now believe however chiefly from observations hermann muller ought have insisted more strongly than did on many adaptations self fertilisation though was aware many such adaptations much enlarged edition fertilisation orchids was published 1877 this same year different forms flowers etc appeared 1880 second edition this book consists chiefly several papers on heterostyled flowers originally published by linnean society corrected with much new matter added together with observations on other cases same plant bears two kinds flowers before remarked no little discovery mine ever gave me so much pleasure making out meaning heterostyled flowers results crossing such flowers an illegitimate manner believe very important bearing on sterility hybrids although these results have been noticed by only few persons 1879 had translation dr ernst krause s life erasmus darwin published added sketch his character habits from material possession many persons have been much interested by this little life am surprised only 800 or 900 copies were sold 1880 published with son frank s assistance power movement plants this was tough piece work book bears somewhat same relation little book on climbing plants cross fertilisation did fertilisation orchids accordance with principle evolution it was impossible account climbing plants having been developed so many widely different groups unless all kinds plants possess slight power movement an analogous kind this proved case was further led rather wide generalisation viz great important classes movements excited by light attraction gravity etc are all modified forms fundamental movement circumnutation it has always pleased me exalt plants scale organised beings therefore felt an especial pleasure showing how many what admirably adapted movements tip root possesses have now 1 1881 sent printers ms little book on formation vegetable mould through action worms this subject but small importance know not whether it will interest any readers between november 1881 february 1884 8500 copies have been sold but it has interested me it completion short paper read before geological society more than forty years ago has revived old geological thoughts have now mentioned all books have published these have been milestones life so little remains said am not conscious any change mind during last thirty years excepting one point presently mentioned nor indeed could any change have been expected unless one general deterioration but father lived his eighty third year with his mind lively ever it was all his faculties undimmed hope die before mind fails sensible extent think have become little more skilful guessing right explanations devising experimental tests but this probably result mere practice larger store knowledge have much difficulty ever expressing myself clearly concisely this difficulty has caused me very great loss time but it has had compensating advantage forcing me think long intently about every sentence thus have been led see errors reasoning own observations or those others there seems sort fatality mind leading me put first statement or proposition wrong or awkward form formerly used think about sentences before writing them down but several years have found it saves time scribble vile hand whole pages quickly possibly can contracting half words then correct deliberately sentences thus scribbled down are often better ones than could have written deliberately having said thus much about manner writing will add with large books spend good deal time over general arrangement matter first make rudest outline two or three pages then larger one several pages few words or one word standing whole discussion or series facts each one these headings again enlarged often transferred before begin write extenso several books facts observed by others have been very extensively used have always had several quite distinct subjects hand same time mention keep from thirty forty large portfolios cabinets with labelled shelves into can once put detached reference or memorandum have bought many books their ends make an index all facts concern work or if book not own write out separate abstract such abstracts have large drawer full before beginning on any subject look all short indexes make general classified index by taking one or more proper portfolios have all information collected during life ready use have said one respect mind has changed during last twenty or thirty years up age thirty or beyond it poetry many kinds such works milton gray byron wordsworth coleridge shelley gave me great pleasure even schoolboy took intense delight shakespeare especially historical plays have also said formerly pictures gave me considerable music very great delight but now many years cannot endure read line poetry have tried lately read shakespeare found it so intolerably dull it nauseated me have also almost lost taste pictures or music music generally sets me thinking too energetically on what have been work on instead giving me pleasure retain taste fine scenery but it does not cause me exquisite delight it formerly did on other hand novels are works imagination though not very high order have been years wonderful relief pleasure me often bless all novelists surprising number have been read aloud me like all if moderately good if they do not end unhappily against law ought passed novel according taste does not come into first class unless it contains person one can thoroughly love if pretty woman all better this curious lamentable loss higher aesthetic tastes all odder books on history biographies travels independently any scientific facts they contain essays on all sorts subjects interest me much ever they did mind seems have become kind machine grinding general laws out large collections facts but why this should have caused atrophy part brain alone on higher tastes depend cannot conceive man with mind more highly organised or better constituted than mine would not suppose have thus suffered if had live life again would have made rule read poetry listen music least once every week perhaps parts brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active through use loss these tastes loss happiness possibly injurious intellect more probably moral character by enfeebling emotional part nature books have sold largely england have been translated into many languages passed through several editions foreign countries have heard it said success work abroad best test its enduring value doubt whether this all trustworthy but judged by this standard name ought last few years therefore it worth while try analyse mental qualities conditions on success has depended though am aware no man can do this correctly have no great quickness apprehension or wit so remarkable clever men instance huxley am therefore poor critic paper or book when first read generally excites admiration it only after considerable reflection perceive weak points power follow long purely abstract train thought very limited therefore could never have succeeded with metaphysics or mathematics memory extensive yet hazy it suffices make me cautious by vaguely telling me have observed or read something opposed conclusion am drawing or on other hand favour it after time can generally recollect where search authority so poor one sense memory have never been able remember more than few days single date or line poetry critics have said oh he good observer but he has no power reasoning do not think this can true origin species one long argument from beginning end it has convinced not few able men no one could have written it without having power reasoning have fair share invention common sense or judgment such every fairly successful lawyer or doctor must have but not believe any higher degree on favourable side balance think am superior common run men noticing things easily escape attention observing them carefully industry has been nearly great it could have been observation collection facts what far more important love natural science has been steady ardent this pure love has however been much aided by ambition esteemed by fellow naturalists from early youth have had strongest desire understand or explain whatever observed group all facts under general laws these causes combined have given me patience reflect or ponder any number years over any unexplained problem far can judge am not apt follow blindly lead other men have steadily endeavoured keep mind free so give up any hypothesis however much beloved cannot resist forming one on every subject soon facts are shown opposed it indeed have had no choice but act this manner with exception coral reefs cannot remember single first formed hypothesis had not after time given up or greatly modified this has naturally led me distrust greatly deductive reasoning mixed sciences on other hand am not very sceptical frame mind believe injurious progress science good deal scepticism scientific man advisable avoid much loss time but have met with not few men feel sure have often thus been deterred from experiment or observations would have proved directly or indirectly serviceable illustration will give oddest case have known gentleman afterwards heard good local botanist wrote me from eastern counties seed or beans common field bean had this year everywhere grown on wrong side pod wrote back asking further information did not understand what was meant but did not receive any answer very long time then saw two newspapers one published kent other yorkshire paragraphs stating it was most remarkable fact beans this year had all grown on wrong side so thought there must foundation so general statement accordingly went gardener an old kentish man asked him whether he had heard anything about it he answered oh no sir it must mistake beans grow on wrong side only on leap year this not leap year then asked him how they grew common years how on leap years but soon found he knew absolutely nothing how they grew any time but he stuck his belief after time heard from first informant with many apologies said he should not have written me had he not heard statement from several intelligent farmers but he had since spoken again every one them not one knew least what he had himself meant so here belief if indeed statement with no definite idea attached it can called belief had spread over almost whole england without any vestige evidence have known course life only three intentionally falsified statements one these have been hoax there have been several scientific hoaxes however took an american agricultural journal it related formation holland new breed oxen by crossing distinct species bos happen know are sterile together author had impudence state he had corresponded with me had been deeply impressed with importance his result article was sent me by editor an english agricultural journal asking opinion before republishing it second case was an account several varieties raised by author from several species primula had spontaneously yielded full complement seed although parent plants had been carefully protected from access insects this account was published before had discovered meaning heterostylism whole statement must have been fraudulent or there was neglect excluding insects so gross scarcely credible third case was more curious mr huth published his book on consanguineous marriage long extracts from belgian author stated he had interbred rabbits closest manner very many generations without least injurious effects account was published most respectable journal royal society belgium but could not avoid feeling doubts hardly know why except there were no accidents any kind experience breeding animals made me think this very improbable so with much hesitation wrote professor van beneden asking him whether author was trustworthy man soon heard answer society had been greatly shocked by discovering whole account was fraud falseness published statements on mr huth relied has been pointed out by himself slip inserted all copies his book then remained unsold writer had been publicly challenged journal say where he had resided kept his large stock rabbits while carrying on his experiments must have consumed several years no answer could extracted from him habits are methodical this has been not little use particular line work lastly have had ample leisure from not having earn own bread even ill health though it has annihilated several years life has saved me from distractions society amusement therefore success man science whatever this have amounted has been determined far can judge by complex diversified mental qualities conditions these most important have been love science unbounded patience long reflecting over any subject industry observing collecting facts fair share invention common sense with such moderate abilities possess it truly surprising should have influenced considerable extent belief scientific men on important point'"
