## Title - Face Recognition using Eigenfaces

This project was done as part of my final year Computer Vision course at the Australian National University.

Eigenfaces refers to an appearance-based approach to face recognition that seeks to capture the variation in a collection of face images and using the captured information to encode and compare images of individual faces.

Refer to **EigenFaces Report.pdf** (and **code.py**) for a step by step explanation of the process and take inspiration for your very own EigenFaces implementation!

#### Following are the results of the first phase of training -
